Binary Tree Implementation in Java
The Repo contains a Java implementation of a binary tree along with a method to check whether the tree is a binary search tree or not.
This tree will be a Binary Search Tree if, for all nodes:
  Each nodes data from the left is less than the data value of that node.
  Each nodes data from the right is greater than the data value of that node.

The function is completed when "is_this_tree_a_binary_search_tree" that receives a root of a tree and
returns a boolean value:
  True if the tree is a Search Binary Tree,
  False otherwise.
